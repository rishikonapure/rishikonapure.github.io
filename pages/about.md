# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}**,

Data Scientist and Instructor at [PrepInsta](www.prepinstaprime.com), where I solve real-world business problems using Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI. I have a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Science from Shivaji University, where I also won a national-level championship on Big Data and Hadoop.

My core competencies include processing, cleaning, and profiling large structured and unstructured data, applying various machine learning algorithms, especially text classification, and developing and deploying web applications using Python, Flask, HTML, and CSS. I also create and share content about Data Science, Tech, and more on various platforms, reaching over 50K followers on Instagram. I am passionate about teaching and mentoring aspiring data scientists and enthusiasts and helping them achieve their goals.
